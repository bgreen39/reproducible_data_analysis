Description: In this package there are multiple variables that you will need to input in order to calculate the Gibbs Free energy of formation.
        This will be a good package to use for geochemists who need gibbs free energy of formation data and include it as part of their data analysis.
        It will also be good for students trying to check their work to see if their calculations for Gibbs free energy of the reaction is correct.
