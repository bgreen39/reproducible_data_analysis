## Good Plot

Description of the plot: The “good” plot shown below shows a line plot
the CO2 levels over the past 10,000 years from ice core data from
several different locations. The data was used from NOAA ice core
database.

\~What is the plot trying to communicate? The plot is trying to
communicate that CO2 levels in the atmosphere have increased over time.

\~Why do you think this plot is successful? I think this line plot is
successful because the data is represented accurately and in a way that
is relatively accessible to those looking at it.

\~Can you think of anything that could make the plot more successful? If
not, what is a common plotting error that this plot avoided? I think
this plot could be improved by using thicker lines in order to make the
lines more visible to those that may be colorblind.

## Bad plot

Describe the plot as you did with the “good” plot. The “bad” plot shows
a bar graph of COVID-19 cases for most impacted counties with the state
of Georgia.

\~What is the plot trying to communicate? The plot is trying to
communicate that the number of COVID-19 cases in Georgia are declining.

\~In what way does the plot obscure the meaning of the data, or mislead
the reader? The plot obscures the meaning of the data by 1) not keeping
up with the order of counties for each day. 2) Putting the dates on the
x-axis in random order.

\~What could be done to make the plot easier to read, or more honest? If
the dates on the x-axis were in chronological order then it would
clearly explain what was happening over time. The bar ,representing each
county, need to be in the same order for each day throughout the graph
to be able to see what was happening within each county compared to
others and overall to determine the trend of COVID-19 cases within the
counties of Georgia.
