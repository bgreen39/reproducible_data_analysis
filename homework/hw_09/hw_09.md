# 1\. Write a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns the number of positions that have an NA in both vectors.

``` r
x <- c(3, 6, 9, 12)
variance.num <-function(x, na.rm=TRUE){
  n <-length(x)
  m <-mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
  sq_err <-(x-m)^2
  sum(sq_err)/(n-1)
}

print(variance.num(x))
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
#Numeric vector=x, n=length function, m=mean and use equation from exercise
```

# 2\. Write both\_na(), a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns the number of positions that have an NA in both vectors

``` r
skew.num <-function(x, na.rm=FALSE){
  v <-variance.num(x, na.rm=na.rm)
  n <-length(x)
  m <-mean(x, na.rm=na.rm)
  (sum((x-m)^3/(n-2))/v^(3/2))
}

print(skew.num(x))
```

# 3\. Write a function to create a specific kind of plot, with useful labels, etc., that can take a data frame as an argument.

``` r
data_plot <-function(x,y){
  x <-c(2,3,6,7)
  y <-c(1,2,3,4)
  p <-ggplot(data, aes_string(x,y))+
    geom_point()
    xlab("x data")
    ylab("y data")
}
```

# 4\. Write a function that takes one argument and does the following

## If argument is a numeric vector, multiples every number in the vector by 2. If argument is a character vector, sorts the vector into alphabetical order. If argument is anything else, issues an information warning and returns the argument unchanged.

``` r
jack_of_trades <-function(arg) {
  go <-if(is.numeric(arg)) {
    arg*2
  } else if(is.character(arg)) {
  sort(arg)
  } else if(!is.numeric(arg)) if(!is.character(arg)) {
  warning("Entry needs to be either a numeric vector or character vector")
  }
  go
}
```

# 5\. Write a function that tries to calculate the mean of a vector using mean ().

## This line calculates the mean of the vector ‘x’.

``` r
mean(is.na(x))
```

    ## [1] 0

## This line calculates vector ‘x’ divided by the sum of the vector ‘x’.

``` r
x / sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4

# 6\. Use system.time() to compare how long it takes to add two, 1-million-element random vectors and store the result in a third vector.

## You have to download library(microbenchmark) in order to perform these lines of code.

``` r
system.time(for (i in 1:1000000) {i+i})
```

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   0.013   0.000   0.013

## Calculates the elapsed time for the system to calculate the function for time that has been pre-allocated.

``` r
pre_allo <-numeric(0)
  system.time(pre_allo <-c(for(i in 1:1000000) {i+i}))
```

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   0.012   0.000   0.013

## Calculates the elapsed time for the system to calculate the function for time that has NOT been pre-allocated.

``` r
  system.time(not_pre_allo <-for(i in 1:1000000) {i+i})
```

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   0.012   0.000   0.012

## In these 2 lines of code I created 2 vectors with a million random elements and used the “sample” function that says to r ‘randomly pick 1000000 numbers from the integers 1:1000000’.

``` r
million_1 <-sample(x=1000000, 1000000)
million_2 <-sample(x=1000000, 1000000)
```
