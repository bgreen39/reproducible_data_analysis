1.  Seeing the documentation of flights

<!-- end list -->

``` r
?nycflights13::flights
```

2.  Using the glimpse() function we can get a general sense of the
    “flights” data frame. There are 336,776 rows and 19 columns.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#glimpse(flights)
```

3.  Using the filter() function we create a data frame of just the
    flights that departed 2 hours late or more and we see that 120,382
    out of 336,776 flights were delayed by 2 hours.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#late_flights <-filter(flights, dep_delay >= 2)
```

4.Using mutate() and paste0 we create a column that contains the
combined airline and flight number.

This line combines flight and airline number.

``` r
#flights_combined_airline_and_number <-mutate(late_flights, combined.air.flight.number = paste0(carrier, flight)) 
```

Charts in view to check correct mutation.

``` r
#glimpse(flights_combined_airline_and_number, !(is.na(tailnum)))
```

Removes flights without a plane tail number.

``` r
#cleaned_flights <- filter(flights_combined_airline_and_number, tailnum, carrier) 
```

5.Use group() to groups certain flights together.

``` r
#cleaned_grouped_flights <-group_by(cleaned_flights, tailnum, carrier)
#glimpse(cleaned_grouped_flights)
#number_of_flights <- summarise(cleaned_grouped_flights, number.of.flights = n())
```
